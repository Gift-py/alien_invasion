# alien_invasion
A fun weekend project built with guidance from Python Crash Course book.

To play:
1. Clone the repo and make sure you're on the master branch.
2. Install requirements `pip install requirements.txt`
3. Run `python alien_invasion.py`

High scores are not persisted across runs, but a simple mechanism can be added to save scores to a file and read from it.
